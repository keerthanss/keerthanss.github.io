Hi there! Thank you for visiting my site.

I'm Keerthan. I have many interests and I consider this blog space to be my personal notepad in my exploration of them and my thoughts.

I dabble in AI research currently, specifically reinforcement learning, and I'm very excited about the same. I am also a student of Western piano and Carnatic violin. I occasionally write music, and hope to build the skill further. I love the outdoors and nature, and wish I could live in such a setting again. I enjoy reading and gaming.

Come say hi!
