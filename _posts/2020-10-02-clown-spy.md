This is the first time I worked with trumpets and horns in a composition, and I had a lot of fun doing it! They make for very interesting and dramatic sounds. I also learnt quite a bunch with respect to drum rhythms thanks to Sagar Sir.

All in all, this composition features trumpets, horns, bass guitar, vibraphone, violin, drums and piano, and is composed in Bb major. Hope you enjoy!
