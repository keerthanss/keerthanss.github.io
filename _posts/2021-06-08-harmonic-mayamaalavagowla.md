For the past few months, I have been learning Carnatic violin. It's been fascinating being introduced to all the new _raaga_ or scales, and the complexities in rhythm or _taala_. Where Carnatic champions melodic and rhythmic development, Western Classical music specialises in harmony. I have since been keen to see how these two may intermesh together.

Recently, when practicing harmonic minor scales on the piano, I realised how similar it is to the _mayamaalavagowla raaga_ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayamalavagowla">wiki</a>) in Carnatic. Only the second and third notes' position are changed, with the rest staying where they are. 

In carnatic notation, this looks like:
Mayamaalavagowla raaga- Sa Re<sub>1</sub> Ga<sub>3</sub> Ma<sub>1</sub> Pa Da<sub>1</sub> Ne<sub>3</sub> 
Harmonic minor scale  - Sa Re<sub>2</sub> Ga<sub>2</sub> Ma<sub>1</sub> Pa Da<sub>1</sub> Ne<sub>3</sub> 

Fixing the scale in the key of D, this becomes:
Mayamaalavagowla raaga- D Eb F# G A Bb C# D
Harmonic minor scale  - D E F G A Bb C# D

This made me really enthusiastic to try to compose a piece that transitions between these scales, and see if this may be achieved seamlessly. This piece is a humble attempt at the same. The raaga permits very interesting chord structures, particularly the presence of both III (F# major) and iii (F# minor) chords within the scale, that demand to be explored. I also tried to induce a carnatic percussive feel on the piano at around the 1 minute mark, an influence perhaps from Mozart's Turkish March.

Hope you enjoy!
