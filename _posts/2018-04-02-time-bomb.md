This is the first time I tried a thematic track. The theme is essentially one wherein the clock is ticking. It's easy to think of a time bomb defusal scenario, but hopefully it equally applies to any scenario with a similar sense of rising tension and impending doom. I think this score is an outcome of playing too much Counter Strike lately!

I was particularly happy about transposing melodies between the bass and treble in this piece. The inspiration came from Bach, and is common in Baroque and Classical era music. I later found it appearing even in Beethoven's Sonatas. The chord progression, I-iidim-iv-III, was also a new experiment, and is interesting in the absence of the v. The progression alone perhaps gave rise to this piece, coupled with the simple march of notes along the minor scale. Lastly, I hope the ending mimics the feel of the ambiguous climaxes of trailer music. This piece was composed in C minor.
